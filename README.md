# Simple-Landing-Page---Cake-Shop
This is one of my first web development projects as a student of Systems Analysis and Development.

What I practiced here:

Basic HTML: How to organize a page with titles, images, and sections.

CSS Styling: Learning how to use colors, fonts, and making the page look good on mobile phones (Responsive Design).

Basic JavaScript: I created a simple script to open and close the menu on mobile devices.

Why I built this: I wanted to apply what I'm learning in college to a real-world example, helping a local business have an online presence.
